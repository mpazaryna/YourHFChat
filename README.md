# YourHFChat

This code seems to be a Streamlit app that creates a chatbot using the Starchat model from Hugging Face Hub. The chatbot interacts with the user, displays the conversation in a chat-like interface, and logs the conversation history into a file named "chathistory.txt". It's using Streamlit's chat input and chat message components to handle user input and display the responses from the assistant. The messages are processed and generated by the Starchat.  

```sh
python3 -m streamlit run streamlit_app.py  
```
